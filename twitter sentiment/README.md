# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

The file twitter_sentiment.py uses python's tweepy library to search
twitter for a key word, and then uses python's textblob library to rank
the tweet's polarity and subjectivity. Laslty, matplotlib is used to create 
pie chart based on the positivity, negativity, and neutrality of the tweets 
returned by the search word.
